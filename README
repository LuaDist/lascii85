This is an ascii85 library for Lua 5.0. Ascii85 is a format for coding binary
data with text, introduced in Postscript and used in PDF. It is similar to but
more efficient than the Base64 used in MIME.

To try this Lua library, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua.
Then run make. This will build lascii85.so and run a simple test. If everything
is ok, install lascii85.so and ascii85.lua in some official place. You may want
to edit ascii85.lua to change the default value of SOPATH (you can also set the
environment variable LUA_SOPATH at run time).

Here is a brief explanation of the files in this package:
  lascii85.c        ascii85 library
  ascii85.lua       support code
  test.lua          test code

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive. There are two
functions: encode and decode. The examples in test.lua show the library in
action.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
